# Privacy Policy — ESPN Dark Mode

**Last updated:** February 2025

## Summary

ESPN Dark Mode does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data whatsoever.

## What the extension does

ESPN Dark Mode is a browser extension that modifies the visual appearance of ESPN.com pages by injecting CSS styles and running a JavaScript scanner locally in your browser. All processing happens entirely on your device.

## Data collection

This extension collects **no data**. Specifically:

- **No personal information** is collected
- **No browsing history** is tracked
- **No cookies** are read or written
- **No network requests** are made by the extension
- **No analytics or telemetry** of any kind
- **No data is sent** to any server, third party, or external service

## Permissions

The extension uses the `storage` permission solely to remember your on/off toggle preference. This data is stored locally in Chrome's sync storage and is never transmitted anywhere. No other permissions are requested beyond content script injection on `espn.com` domains.

## Changes to this policy

If this policy changes, the update will be posted here and the extension version will be incremented.
